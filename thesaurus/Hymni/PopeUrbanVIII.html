<h2>
<center>Pope Urban VIII</center>
</h2>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

<p>Maffeo Barberini was born in Florence in April, 1568, elected Pope
Urban VIII on 6 August, 1623, and died at Rome, 29 July, 1644. He has
a number of calls to fame, one being that he was involved with the
Galileo affair. He also was an active pope who carried out a number
of reforms of the Church, some good, some not so good. One of his
less successful reforms was his reform of the Roman Breviary.</p>

<p>Pope Urban VIII was an excellent classical Latinist and felt that
the hymns of the Roman Breviary needed to be reshaped into classical
models. He was by no means the first to feel this way, but he has the
distinction of being the Pope who actually carried out such an
extensive revision of the hymns of the Roman Breviary into classical
models. While a committee was appointed for the task, it is clear
that the Pope personally oversaw the revision. Urban VIII was not
content to leave alone the works of such great Latin Hymnists such as
Prudentius, Fortunatus, or even Ambrose, but instead molded their
works and the works of others into classical forms. The revision of
the hymn texts was approved by the Congregation of Rites on March 29,
1629 and on January 25, 1631, the revised Roman Breviary was
authorized for publication.</p>

<p>History and scholars have generally held that these revisions were
very ill-advised. Indeed, those orders who were able to resist the
revisions did so. Claiming the privilege of exemption granted by Pope
Pius V because of the antiquity of their own Breviaries, the
Dominicans, Benedictines, Cistercians, and Carthusians refused to
adopt the revisions. Moreover, the revisions were never accepted at
St. Peter's or the Lateran in Rome itself! This produced two distinct
versions of the Latin hymnal that were to coexist for more than three
hundred years. It was only until the recently that the mess was
straightened out.</p>

<p>Due to the widespread use and familiarity many have with
Urban's
revised hymns, I have tried to indicate his revisions as footnotes to
the original text and thereby hopefully clear up some of the
confusion that lingers today.</p>
