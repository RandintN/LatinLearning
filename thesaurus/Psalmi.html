            <td>
            <p><font size="-1">The Psalms contain
150 prayers, poems,
and hymns that give praise and adoration of God and sum up the
major aspects of our relationship with Him. They are the foremost
public
prayers of the Church for they were given to us by God through the Holy
Spirit. By praying the Psalms, God puts into our mouths the
words He wishes to hear.</font> </p>

            <p><font size="-1">The psalms have been
treasured by all
Christians throughout history. Perhaps St. Ambrose, in his Explanation
of the Psalms (Office of the Readings, Saturday of the tenth
week of Ordinary time, ICEL) put it best when he wrote:</font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="-1">What is more
pleasing than a psalm?
David expresses it well: Praise the Lord, for a song of praise
is good: let there be praise of our God with gladness and
grace. Yes, a psalm is a blessing on the lips of the people, a
hymn of praise of God, the assembly's homage, a general
acclamation, a word that speaks for all, the voice of the
Church, a confession of faith in song. It is the voice of
complete assent, the joy of freedom, a cry of happiness, the
echo of gladness. It soothes the temper, distracts from care,
lightens the burden of sorrow. It is a source of security at
night, a lesson in wisdom by day. It is a shield when we are
afraid, a celebration of holiness, a vision of serenity, a
promise of peace and harmony. It is like a lyre, evoking
harmony from a blend of notes. Day begins to the music of a
psalm. Day close to the echo of a psalm.</font></p>

              <p><font size="-1">In a psalm
instruction vies with
beauty. We sing for pleasure. We learn for profit. What experience
is not covered by a reading of the psalms? I come across the
words: A song for the beloved, and I am aflame with the desire
for God's love. I go through God's revelation in all its
beauty, the intimations of resurrection, the gifts of his promise. I
learn to avoid sin. I see my mistake in feeling ashamed of
repentance for my sins.</font></p>

              <p><font size="-1">What is a psalm but
a musical
instrument to give expression to all the virtues? The psalmist of old
used it, with the aid of the Holy Spirit, to make the earth
reecho the music of heaven, He used the dead gut of strings to
create a harmony from a variety of notes, in order to send up
to heaven the song of God's praise. In doing so he taught us that we
must first die to sin, and then create in our lives on earth a harmony
through virtuous deeds, if the grace of our devotion is to reach up to
the Lord.</font> </p>

              <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></p>

            </blockquote>

            <p><font size="-1">The choice of which
set of Latin psalms
to place on line is problematical for many different versions
have been used over the centuries. The most well know set of
psalms in Latin comes from Jerome's Vulgate and is know as the
Gallican Psalter. The Gallican Psalter is not a work of Jerome
himself, but an edition of the Old Latin that he put together
before he did his Vulgate translation. The Bible had been
translated into Latin long before Jerome started his famous
translation in the 4th century. There were numerous Old Latin
editions of the Scripture and Jerome attempted to edit them and
bring them into conformity with one another and with the Greek
Scriptures. Given the wide divergences amongst the texts, this
proved not to be an easy task. Jerome felt that a fresh
translation was in order, so he abandoned this work and began
his work on the Vulgate. After the Vulgate came out, people
objected to Jerome's Hebrew based Psalter, which was the
original set of psalms in the Vulgate, and preferred to retain
the Old Latin version of the psalms. Copyists obliged and
simply replaced Jerome's original Vulgate Psalms with the Old
Latin Gallican edition that Jerome has edited some years before.</font>
            </p>

            <p><font size="-1">While the Vulgate
became the standard
Latin Bible in the fourth century, it was not adopted universally until
the 8th century. Rome, in particular, was slow to adopt the Vulgate.
The Scriptural extracts in oldest parts of the Roman Liturgy are not
from the Vulgate, but from the Old Latin. A cursory comparison
between the texts of the Liturgy and the Vulgate will expose
the differences. To complicate the situation even further,
there are also multiple editions of the Vulgate that appeared
down through the centuries. While each of these editions
resemble each other reasonably well, still there are
divergences amongst different texts. The Sixto-Clementine
edition of Jerome's Vulgate, which came out in 1592, is
perhaps the one most familiar to most people today. It had
been the standard text until recently when the Nova Vulgata
was published in 1979.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1">Another psalter in
recent use that bears mention is the Psalter of Pius XII. Pope Pius XII
ordered a fresh
translation of the psalms from the Hebrew. It never really caught on.
In this author's opinion, that was a good thing. While the Psalter of
Pius XII has value as an aid to Scripture Study, its prayability and
singability are low. It is more like reading Cicero than Scripture.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1">So as can be seen
from the above, there
is no lack of different Latin texts to choose from for the Psalms. I
have chosen to put two sets of Latin Psalms on-line. First, I
have selected the psalter from the old Roman Breviary. This is
the form of the Psalms from the Sixto-Clementine edition of the Vulgate
and was the standard Latin text of the Roman Rite until recently. It is
the form of the psalms used in classical music. The second set
is the text as found in the Nova Vulgata, which is used in the
Liturgia Horarum (post Second Vatican Council). For those interested,
you can get the Nova Vulgata from the Vatican web
site at </font><font size="-1"><a href="http://www.vatican.va">www.vatican.va</a></font><font size="-1">. Both the Vulgata and the Nova Vulgata can be
purchased
from the </font><font size="-1"><a href="http://www.ixtmedia.com">Vatican
Bookstore</a></font><font size="-1">.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1">It should be noted
that there are
several web sites that have a set of psalms in Latin, and some of
them have the rest of the Bible as well. They all claim to be the
Vulgate, which is more or less correct, but two things should
be noted. First, as best I can tell, and others have confirmed
my impressions, all of these share a common source, namely an
early edition of the Benedictine Vulgate published in Stuttgart
in 1969 and 1975. This edition is the result of an effort to
purge the various copyist errors that accumulated over the
centuries and recover as nearly as possible the actual text
set down by Jerome himself. This Benedictine edition was the
starting point for the Nova Vulgata, which incorporates the
results of modern Biblical scholarship. It should be
emphasized that this Benedictine edition is not identical to
the Sixto-Clementine edition. So if it is the Sixto-Clementine edition
that you are looking for, these on-line Vulgates are not the
ones for you. Secondly, and perhaps more seriously, none of
the public domain sites that claim to have the Vulgate online
in fact have a complete version. All of them share a common
source that was generated by someone who left out all of the
Deuterocanonical passages. This means the seven
Deuterocanonical books are missing as well as sections of
Daniel and Esther. Some sites have supplied the missing books,
but I have yet to find any that have supplied the missing parts
of Daniel and Esther. So again, if completeness is important,
you will not find it in these editions.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1">Lastly, a word about
the numbering of
the Psalms. There are two basic schemes, the Greek numbering and
the Hebrew numbering. Until the Protestant Reformation, the
Greek numbering of the psalms from the Septuagint was the universal
scheme. Protestants, for various reasons, adopted the Hebrew numbering
scheme, and, again for various reasons, most modern English Bibles
these days use the Hebrew numbering scheme. The Vulgate uses
this Greek numbering scheme and this is the scheme that I have
used throughout this web site. However, due to the prevalence
of the two numbering schemes, I have listed the psalm numbers
in both schemes below as an aid to the confused. The Vulgate
(Greek) numbering is first and the Hebrew numbering follows.</font>
